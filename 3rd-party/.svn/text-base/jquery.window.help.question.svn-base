Hi,

If we create a window within a absolute positioned element, but the maximize and minimize don't work correctly.

If that parent element has a top value different from zero, the maximized window is supposed to appear with a zero top distance from the parent but, instead, it appear with a top distance which is exactly the value of the ...top offset of its parent. That is, it always doubles the distance from the parent to the body top border.

For my particular situation I just change line 1239, In the construction of associative array targetCssStyle, in maximize method, from
top: cpos.top + btop
to
top: bTop

But for the minimized I didn't find a way to correct this. I am using a also absolute positioned element for the docArea.

Can you help me, please?
